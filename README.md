# Coursera-Project

The site is live: https://adeenasif.github.io/Coursera-Project/

This project was created as part of the **HTML and CSS in Depth** course by **Meta**, which I completed through **Coursera**.

## Overview

This is a simple static website demonstrating core HTML and CSS concepts covered in the course. It showcases:

- Semantic HTML structure
- Responsive design principles
- CSS styling for layout and typography
- Organized project files (HTML, CSS, and assets)

## How It Works

- **HTML (`index.html`)**  
  The main file contains the structure of the webpage, including headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

- **CSS (`style.css`)**  
  The CSS file defines the visual presentation of the website, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout styling.

- **Assets Folder (`assets/`)**  
  This folder holds images and other static resources used by the website.
